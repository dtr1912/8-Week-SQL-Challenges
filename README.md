## Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner
### Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

**Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(price) AS total_price 
FROM   sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP  BY customer_id;
```

Result: 
| customer_id   |   total_price |
|:--------------|--------------:|
| A             |            76 |
| B             |            74 |
| C             |            36 |


**Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id   |   days_visited |
|:--------------|---------------:|
| A             |              4 |
| B             |              6 |
| C             |              2 |

**Q3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
WITH cte AS(
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   s.order_date, 
       m.product_name,
Dense_rank() OVER(partition BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ASC) ranker
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id =m.product_id )
SELECT customer_id, 
       order_date, 
       product_name
FROM cte
WHERE ranker = 1
```
Result:

| customer_id   | order_date   | product_name   |
|:--------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| A             | 2021-01-01   | sushi          |
| A             | 2021-01-01   | curry          |
| B             | 2021-01-01   | curry          |
| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |
| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |


**Q4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

```sql
SELECT s.product_id, 
       m.product_name,
       Count(s.product_id) amount
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id =m.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY amount DESC
```
Result:

|   product_id | product_name   |   amount |
|-------------:|:---------------|---------:|
|            3 | ramen          |        8 |
|            2 | curry          |        4 |
|            1 | sushi          |        3 |


**Q5: Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

```sql
WITH cte AS(
SELECT customer_id, s.product_id, m.product_name, count(customer_id) amount,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY count(customer_id) DESC) ranker
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id =m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name, amount
FROM cte
WHERE ranker=1
```

Result:

| customer_id   | product_name   |   amount |
|:--------------|:---------------|---------:|
| A             | ramen          |        3 |

| C             | ramen          |        3 |


**Q6: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, order_date, m.product_name
FROM menu m
JOIN sales s
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
), cte1 AS(
SELECT c.customer_id, join_date,order_date, product_name, rank() over(partition BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ASC) ranker
FROM cte c
JOIN members m
ON c.customer_id = m.customer_id
WHERE join_date <= order_date
ORDER BY  c.customer_id)
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM cte1
WHERE ranker = 1
```

Result:

| customer_id   | product_name   |
|:--------------|:---------------|
| A             | curry          |
| B             | sushi          |


**Q7: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, order_date, m.product_name
FROM menu m
JOIN sales s
ON s.product_id = m.product_id )
,cte1 AS (SELECT c.customer_id, join_date,order_date, product_name, rank() over(partition BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC ) ranker
FROM cte c
JOIN members m
ON c.customer_id = m.customer_id
WHERE join_date > order_date
ORDER BY  c.customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM cte1
WHERE ranker =1
```

Result:

| customer_id   | product_name   |
|:--------------|:---------------|
| A             | sushi          |
| A             | curry          |
| B             | sushi          |


**Q8: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, order_date, count(s.product_id) item, sum(m.price) total_price
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
WHERE s.product_id=m.product_id
GROUP BY  customer_id, order_date),
cte2 AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, order_date, join_date
FROM sales s
JOIN members m
ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
WHERE order_date < join_date
GROUP BY customer_id,order_date )
SELECT cte1.customer_id, sum(item) item_amount , sum(total_price) total_amount
FROM cte1
JOIN cte2
WHERE cte1.order_date = cte2.order_date AND cte1.customer_id = cte2.customer_id

**Q9: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
WITH cte1 AS
(SELECT s.customer_id, product_name, CASE
WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN sum(2*price)
ELSE sum(price)
end AS point
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY  customer_id, product_name
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name, sum(point)*10 total_points
FROM cte1
GROUP BY customer_id
```

Result:

| customer_id   | product_name   |   total_points |
|:--------------|:---------------|---------------:|
| A             | sushi          |            860 |
| B             | curry          |            940 |
| C             | ramen          |            360 |

**Q10: In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
WITH cte1
AS (
SELECT customer_id, join_date, date(join_date+6) first_week, last_day('2021-01-01') AS jan
FROM members
)
, cte2 AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, product_id, join_date, order_date, first_week, jan
FROM sales s
JOIN cte1 c1
ON s.customer_id = c1.customer_id )
-- where join_date <= order_date < first_week )
, cte3 AS (
SELECT customer_id, c2.product_id, order_date, price
,CASE
WHEN c2.product_id = 1 THEN (20*price)
WHEN order_date BETWEEN join_date AND first_week THEN (20*price)
ELSE (10*price)
end AS point
FROM cte2 c2
JOIN menu m
ON m.product_id = c2.product_id
WHERE order_date < jan
ORDER BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, sum(point) as total_point
FROM cte3
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY  customer_id
```

Result:

| customer_id   |   total_point |
|:--------------|--------------:|
| A             |          1370 |
| B             |           820 |
