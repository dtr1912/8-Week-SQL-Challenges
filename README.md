## Case Study #1: Danny's Diner
### Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

### Case Study Questions

**Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(price) AS total_price 
FROM   sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP  BY customer_id;
```

Result: 
| customer_id   |   total_price |
|:--------------|--------------:|
| A             |            76 |
| B             |            74 |
| C             |            36 |


**Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id   |   days_visited |
|:--------------|---------------:|
| A             |              4 |

WHEN order_date BETWEEN join_date AND first_week THEN (20*price)
ELSE (10*price)
end AS point
FROM cte2 c2
JOIN menu m
ON m.product_id = c2.product_id
WHERE order_date < jan
ORDER BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, sum(point) as total_point

### Bonus Questions
**Join All The Things**

The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.

```sql
SELECT 
      s.customer_id,
      s.order_date,
      m.product_name,
      m.price,
      CASE WHEN mb.customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Y'
           ELSE 'N'
	  END AS member
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
LEFT JOIN members mb ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id AND s.order_date >= mb.join_date
```
Result:

| customer_id   | order_date   | product_name   |   price | member   |
|:--------------|:-------------|:---------------|--------:|:---------|
| A             | 2021-01-01   | sushi          |      10 | N        |
| A             | 2021-01-01   | curry          |      15 | N        |
| A             | 2021-01-07   | curry          |      15 | Y        |
| A             | 2021-01-10   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |
| A             | 2021-01-11   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |
| A             | 2021-01-11   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |
| B             | 2021-01-01   | curry          |      15 | N        |
| B             | 2021-01-02   | curry          |      15 | N        |
| B             | 2021-01-04   | sushi          |      10 | N        |
| B             | 2021-01-11   | sushi          |      10 | Y        |
| B             | 2021-01-16   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |
| B             | 2021-02-01   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |
| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |      12 | N        |
| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |      12 | N        |
| C             | 2021-01-07   | ramen          |      12 | N        |

**Rank All The Things**

Danny also requires further information about the `ranking` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null `ranking` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

```sql
WITH cte1 AS(
SELECT 
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.order_date ASC) AS order_id,
      s.customer_id,
      s.order_date,
      m.product_name,
      m.price,
      CASE WHEN mb.customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Y'
           ELSE 'N'
	  END AS member
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
LEFT JOIN members mb ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id AND s.order_date >= mb.join_date
),
cte2 AS(
SELECT *,
	   RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rnk
FROM cte1
WHERE member = 'Y'
)

SELECT c1.customer_id,
       c1.order_date,
       c1.product_name,
       c1.price,
       c1.member,
       c2.rnk
FROM cte1 c1
LEFT JOIN cte2 c2 ON c1.order_id = c2.order_id;
```

Result:
| customer_id   | order_date   | product_name   |   price | member   |   rnk |
|:--------------|:-------------|:---------------|--------:|:---------|------:|
| A             | 2021-01-01   | sushi          |      10 | N        |   nan |

| A             | 2021-01-07   | curry          |      15 | Y        |     1 |
| A             | 2021-01-10   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |     2 |
| A             | 2021-01-11   | ramen          |      12 | Y        |     3 |

| B             | 2021-01-01   | curry          |      15 | N        |   nan |
| B             | 2021-01-02   | curry          |      15 | N        |   nan |
| B             | 2021-01-04   | sushi          |      10 | N        |   nan |
| B             | 2021-01-11   | sushi          |      10 | Y        |     1 |

| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |      12 | N        |   nan |
| C             | 2021-01-01   | ramen          |      12 | N        |   nan |
| C             | 2021-01-07   | ramen          |      12 | N        |   nan |
